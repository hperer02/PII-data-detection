We were in contact\\n\\nwith Cap\\u00e3o das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of S\\u00e3o Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Cap\\u00e3o  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nIn order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test\\n\\nwere we delivered the products at the costumer\\u2019s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAfter we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be\\n\\nthe most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.\\n\\nIn order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the\\n\\nfarmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.\\n\\nInsights\\n\\nThe application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building\\n\\na solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nDuring all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on\\n\\nwhat we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Diego Estrada\\n\\nDesign Thinking Assignment\\n\\nVisualization Tool\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.\\n\\nAfter learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.\\n\\nAfter having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.\\n\\nThe use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? \\u2026). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.\\n\\nInsight & Approach\\n\\nThe use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to\\n\\nDiego Estrada\\n\\nfind a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.\\n\\nPresentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.\\n\\n(This story is fictional and was created for solving the assignment)\\n\\n\",\n          \"Cheese Startup - Learning Launch \\u200bby Eladio Amaya\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nWe are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection\\n\\nI have chosen the \\\"Learning Launch\\\" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application\\n\\nDue to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight\\n\\nThe result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nOur situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
